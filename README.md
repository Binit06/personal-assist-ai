## Smart Chat Assistant — Prototype Inspired by Text.ai

- Built with: Gemini API, Python/JS/React (or whatever you used)
- What it does:
  - Detects tone of user in real-time (using ML)
  - Dynamically adapts AI responses to match tone
  - Triggers scheduling popup if chat includes intent like "schedule a task"
  - Integrates with Outlook to fetch unread event emails and creates reminders

- Why it matters:
  This is a next-gen AI assistant for messaging platforms, aligning closely with Text.ai’s vision of making chat more intelligent and productive.
